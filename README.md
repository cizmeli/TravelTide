# TravelTide

This project performs customer segmentation analysis on travel data using KMeans clustering. It starts with data loading and preprocessing, conducts exploratory data analysis, applies PCA for dimensionality reduction, determines the optimal number of clusters, performs KMeans clustering, visualizes the clusters, and finally analyzes the characteristics of each segment.

The analysis process follows best practices for unsupervised learning by examining data distribution, reducing dimensionality while preserving information, evaluating different numbers of clusters using both the elbow method and silhouette scores, and visualizing the results in 2D space.
